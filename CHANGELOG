# CHANGELOG

- 0.3.4 (Feb 25 2021)
    *  fixes the broken build caused by newer versions of protolude.
    *  integration tests scripts works with Python3.

- 0.3.3 (May 25 2019)
    *  relax the lower bound of `base` library version that was erroneously
       raised while debugging a build failure.

- 0.3.2 (May 24 2019)
    *  upgrade to stack lts-13.22 (no code changes)

- 0.3.1 (May 24 2019)
    *  specify hedgehog version bounds, since hedgehog 1.0 breaks tests.

- 0.3.0 (May 06 2019)
    *  `Rendezvous.runClient` takes an extra parameter to pass an optional
       externally created socket for the websocket server. This is useful
       for running the protocol via a proxy like the tor program, which
       exposes a socks proxy.
    *  Upper bound of the `base` library dependency relaxed so that the
       library builds with newer releases of GHC which comes bundled with
       corresponding versions of the `base` library.

- 0.2.1 (October 23 2018)
    *  Loosened base version constraint

- 0.2.0 (October 23 2018)
    *  API enhancements to support [wormhole-client](https://github.com/LeastAuthority/wormhole-client)

- 0.1.0 (January 17 2018)
    *  Initial release
    *  Exchange text messages with Magic Wormhole peers
